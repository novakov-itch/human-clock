# Human Clock: Development


## Architecture

- Interface is responsible for handling of user actions.
- *GeneratorService* generates song based on user preferences in JSON format.
- *OrchestraService* plays the song generated by the *GeneratorService*.
- *SchedulerService* calls *OrchestraService* at the right time.

```
def createAlarm(alarmTime, alarmPreferences):
    generatedSong = generatorService.generate(alarmPreferences)

    schedulerService.playAtTime(alarmTime, generatedSong)
```


### Service: Generator

1. What are the input parameters of `generate` method?
2. What is the output of the `generate` method?


## Service: Orchestra

Input parameters of orchestra are:

1. Song parameters
2. Line for each instrument over time

{
    "bpm": number
    "instruments": {
        "techno01:kick-small": []
        "techno01:kick-big": []
    }
}


## Tools & Technologies

* Git, source code management.
    * Concepts: branches, commits, pull requests.
* JSON, format used for communication between services.
    * What is similar to JSON in Python, and what can be formatted as JSON?
* Python 3.8.x, main language for *GeneratorService* and *OrchestraService*.
    * How to create `*.test.py` file which can be executed from the CLI?
* Qt 5.12.x, main framework for application development.
* Semantic Versioning
